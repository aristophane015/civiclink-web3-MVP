The Web3 Government Structure Navigator API provides decentralized access to verified government structure data, leveraging blockchain technology (smart contracts) for transparency. It supports low-availability environments by enabling offline caching and syncing when connectivity is restored.

Key Features
Blockchain-backed data: Verified government roles and officials stored in smart contracts.

Offline support: Cached data for low-connectivity environments.

Immutable records: Ensures tamper-proof and auditable data.
